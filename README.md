# minq

Minq is a proxy app that replicates the parallel dense linear algebra
components of a plane-wave or real-space density functional theory
code. It is based on the inq code (https://gitlab.com/npneq/inq).

The linear algebra operations are done using the Slate parallel linear
algebra library (https://icl.utk.edu/slate/).

The code is being developed by Xavier Andrade <xavier@llnl.gov>.
